# Slide Quality Pass - First 4 Slides

Date: 2026-05-15

Scope locked to `cs-frontier-iconic`, `cs-1m8`, `cs-a7m1`, `cs-1bm1` in `GnR_deck.html`.

## cs-frontier-iconic

### Plan

Current strengths: full-bleed hero treatment is already in place; the four-line headline structure preserves the core thesis; brand emphasis colors are tuned for contrast against the warm image.

Identified weaknesses: the slide has no explicit GnR mark in the upper-right corner even though the hero-slide convention calls for one; the headline has strong text shadow already, but the block should be capped slightly tighter so it reads as intentional thesis typography rather than a wide paragraph.

Sharpening moves: add a small upper-right GnR mark using the existing blue/gold/rust wordmark treatment; tighten the headline max-width enough to keep the line rhythm deliberate while preserving the existing four-line span structure, copy, colors, and shadows.

Will not touch: hero image generation, image asset, line copy, four-line headline text, full-bleed treatment, entry animation.

### After

Added the missing upper-right GnR mark with the deck's blue/gold/rust treatment and tightened the headline measure from 1180px to 1120px. The full-bleed image, four-line headline text, emphasis colors, quiet-zone placement, and entry animation were preserved.

## cs-1m8

### Plan

Current strengths: 4-stage reveal is intact; the wordmark, caption columns, contact card, and dated alignment comments are preserved; right caption translateX(86px) carries Dave's latest visual-center correction.

Identified weaknesses: the caption typography uses darker ad hoc blue/red variants (`#3a73b8`, `#c94d32`) in label positions where the design system wants exact brand blue/rust; the stage container can use a little more vertical breathing room without changing the animation mechanics; contact card contrast is acceptable but slightly quiet.

Sharpening moves: tune caption label colors back to exact brand colors while preserving inline content and transforms; give the stage stack a modest vertical balance adjustment only if it does not disturb the 4-stage reveal; lift contact-card readability a notch by increasing the email underline contrast and body opacity.

Will not touch: the 4-stage click reveal, `cs1m8Advance`, `cs1m8Reverse`, wordmark span structure, caption text, contact card content, right-caption `translateX(86px)`, dated comments, or any JS controller.

### After

Pending.

## cs-a7m1

### Plan

Current strengths: the stacked comparison now reads problem-to-vision; both cards are flippable; Dave's restored 3-stick-figure SVG and newer entry animation sequence are intact.

Identified weaknesses: the right card's dashed ring is still quieter than the left orb's dashed border at presentation scale; the back captions can carry slightly stronger contrast without changing their wording; the card vertical rhythm is close but the two-card gap can be tightened a touch so the slide reads as one comparison unit.

Sharpening moves: boost the right dashed ring opacity/stroke very slightly; align the left orb dashed border visibility to the same system; raise caption contrast through CSS weight/shadow-free color tuning; reduce the stacked card gap slightly while preserving both flip faces and all animation selectors.

Will not touch: both flippable card structures, front/back content, restored 3-stick-figure SVG, stacked-envelope SVG, `data-flipped` behavior, entry animation timing, or deleted-content comments.

### After

Pending.

## cs-1bm1

### Plan

Current strengths: both chart cards preserve the full visual argument; the double-arrow bridge and independent card flipping are intact; dated comments capture the bar-order and placeholder history.

Identified weaknesses: the main headline is a little small for a thesis slide; the gold void labels and question mark can read too quiet next to the filled bars; dashed void tracks have the right behavior but could use more visual punch after flip.

Sharpening moves: increase headline scale slightly and cap its width for cleaner line rhythm; deepen/punch the void-row gold labels and question mark without changing copy; strengthen dashed void tracks by a small opacity/box-shadow adjustment while preserving animation and card flip mechanics.

Will not touch: chart content, logo SVGs, bar widths, bridge, left/right flip interactivity, bottom community icons, dated iteration comments, or `cs1bm1Toggle`.

### After

Pending.
