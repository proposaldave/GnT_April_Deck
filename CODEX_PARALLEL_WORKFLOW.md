# Codex Parallel Deck Workflow

## Edit Sessions

1. Use Worktree mode only.
2. Paste `prompts/CODEX_PARALLEL_DECK_TASK_PROMPT.txt`.
3. Dave adds only the desired edit at the bottom.
4. Codex creates an acceptance contract, finds the active live slide/section, edits only that target, and self-corrects once if verification fails.
5. The session creates `deck/[short-task-name]`, commits, and does not push.
6. The session reports `DONE` only after active-source verification and required rendered/visual verification pass.
7. The session leaves a publish-readable `PUBLISH TRACE`: request slug, active slide ID, changed visible text, changed selectors/properties, changed registry keys, asset paths, source verification, and visual QA result.

## Active Source Contract

- Main-flow slides are active only when present in `SLIDE_ORDER`.
- Dot variants are active only when present in the correct `SLIDE_ALTS[slot]`.
- Staff slides are active only when present in `STAFF_ORDER`.
- If the visible requested target is not active, stop with `BLOCKED` and report the inactive slide ID instead of editing it.
- Red dots are alternate candidates for the same slot, not different slides.
- Codex owns verification. Dave should not have to inspect branches or identify failed edits manually.
- Visual/layout/copy-positioning/image/order edits require rendered evidence unless Dave explicitly approves source-only.
- If verification fails, Codex attempts one targeted correction, verifies again, then reports `BLOCKED` with the root cause.

## Slide Inventory Guard

- `SLIDE_ORDER` is the active-slide inventory, not just implementation detail.
- No edit or publish session may remove an ID from `SLIDE_ORDER` unless Dave explicitly requested that exact slide be deleted, trashed, moved to appendix, or moved to an alt rail.
- Any session that changes `SLIDE_ORDER` must report `ADDED_SLIDES`, `REMOVED_SLIDES`, and the active-slot reason for every removed slide.
- If a slide disappears without explicit request, restore it before committing or publishing.
- Use `tools/verify_slide_order_guard.ps1 -BaseRef <before> -TargetRef WORKTREE` during edit sessions and before publish commits whenever order changes. After commit, `-TargetRef HEAD` is also acceptable.

## Publish Sessions

1. Use Local mode on `main`.
2. Paste `prompts/CODEX_DECK_PUBLISH_PROMPT.txt`.
3. Preserve unrelated dirty work before publishing.
4. Build the publish universe from checked-out worktrees plus every local `refs/heads/deck/*` branch, especially branches not contained in `origin/main`.
5. Merge verified safe `deck/*` branches; when a completed branch is stale but the intent is clear, port the intent surgically onto current `main` instead of dropping it.
6. Do not use `skip` as a silent final state for completed work. If a completed branch cannot be merged or ported, report `BLOCKED` with the exact branch, blocker, and next action.
7. If `SLIDE_ORDER` changed, run the slide inventory guard before committing. Unauthorized active-slide removal is a hard blocker, not a warning.
8. If a restored or inserted slide shifts later active slots, update affected `SLIDE_ALTS` keys in the same publish pass.
9. Copy `GnR_deck.html` to `index.html`, verify hash identity, push if requested, then verify raw GitHub and Pages source.
10. Report exactly what is `MERGED AND LIVE`, `SKIPPED / NEEDS REVIEW`, `CONFLICTS`, and `NOT VERIFIED`.

## Dave Workflow

Normal edit:
New Codex chat -> GnR_Deck -> New worktree -> main -> No environment -> 5.5 Medium -> paste normal edit request.

Dave only provides the desired edit.
Codex must verify active rendered success or report `BLOCKED`.

Publish:
Deck Ops session -> Work locally -> main -> use publish prompt.
Publish merges only verified safe branches and reports exactly what went live.

Completed-session rule:
A solid status dot in the Codex app means the worktree session is done. Publish control should treat the matching `deck/*` branch as a publish candidate, not wait for Dave to name it again. Merge it if it is clean and active-source verified. If a direct merge would roll back newer live work, port the requested intent surgically. If neither is safe, report `BLOCKED` with the exact blocker.

Before declaring a publish pass done, run a completed-session audit: compare `git worktree list --porcelain`, all local `refs/heads/deck/*` branches, merge status against `origin/main`, branch commit messages, and current `main`. Every completed candidate must be merged, ported, or blocked with evidence. Do not leave completed work behind under a generic skipped label.

Unpublished-local-branch rule:
`git worktree list --porcelain` is not enough. A finished branch can exist without a checked-out worktree. Before `DONE`, prove `UNPUBLISHED_LOCAL_DECK_REFS=0` for local `deck/*` branches not contained in `origin/main`, or list every remaining branch under `BLOCKED`, `CONFLICTS`, or `NOT VERIFIED` with the next action.

Failed-visible-phrase rule:
When Dave reports a missed visible phrase or asks "didn't I ask...", search all local `deck/*` branch contents and diffs for the exact old text, likely replacement, nearby slide ID, and screenshot context. If a branch contains the requested tiny copy/layout/registry intent, port it to current `main`, verify the active source/render result, then mark the source branch integrated. Do not ask Dave to find the branch again.

Branch-intent audit:
For every completed-session branch, diff the branch against its merge-base and extract the actual intent: visible text, active slide IDs, selectors, JavaScript hooks, assets, and registry edits. Verify that intent exists in current `main` before calling it integrated. An `ours` merge is allowed only after the intent has already been ported and verified. If a branch is an ancestor of `main` but the visible result is absent, treat it as a failed publish and repair it before reporting `DONE`.

Never run multiple Local edit sessions against `GnR_deck.html`.
Never edit the old `pitch_visuals` copy during parallel work.
Never push from parallel edit sessions.
